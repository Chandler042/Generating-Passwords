# Generating-Passwords
First i had to create varables for numbers and letters and specials characters to use later in javascript. 
I started my generatePassword function and immediately created varables for what my output would be and how this output would be created. (find on lines 23-24) created how long the length of my password would be through a prompt and then asked my four questions of what they wanted this password to consist of. At the end starting on line 61 i created my loop to randomize what they selected. Using google i found the words Math.floor and all that to finish up my generting the password. 
My only issue is how to create the alert for if they dont choose in between those characters length
